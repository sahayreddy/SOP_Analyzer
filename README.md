🎓 AI-Powered University SOP Analyzer:
A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) tool for institution-specific essay analysis.

🌟 Project HighlightsInstitution-Specific Critique:
 1.Unlike general AI, this tool compares student drafts against a private database of real successful essays.
 2.Advanced RAG Architecture: Implements a full Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline using vector embeddings and semantic search.
 3.Interactive Dashboard: A sleek web interface with a real-time "Institutional Fit" gauge.
 
 🚀 The Problem & Motivation:
 Standard AI tools give generic writing advice. However, every university (Harvard vs. Johns Hopkins) has a distinct "vibe" and set of values they look for in a Statement of Purpose (SOP). I built this project to bridge that gap, providing students with a tool that uses actual successful examples as a benchmark for feedback.

 🧠 How It Works (The RAG Pipeline):
  1.Data Ingestion: Successful essays are cleaned, chunked, and converted into mathematical vectors (embeddings).
  2.Semantic Retrieval: When a student pastes a draft, the system searches the database for the 2 most similar successful essays from the same university.
  3.Context Injection: These examples are injected into a specialized "Admissions Dean" prompt.Analysis: Gemini 2.5 identifies precisely what is missing in the student's draft compared to the winners.# SOP_Analyzer
